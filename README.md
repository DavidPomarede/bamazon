##  your virtual command-line marketplace!

Welcome to Bamazon, a fully-integrated command line inventory system for tracking sales!

In order to run this in node, make sure once you have navigated to the root directory of your install, that you have installed the dependencies using:

> npm install

In addition to this, you will want to replace your MySQL login information at the top of the three files, for customer, manager, and supervisor.

As follows is a brief overview of the three different portals.

_The Customer Portal:_

#### This portal is simple: customers are prompted directly as to what kind of item they want, they enter the ID number of the item, then the quantity. The stock quantity of the item is reduced, the purchase total is calculated, and added to the gross profits of that Department category.


_The Manager Portal:_

#### Here the manager is offered a range of choices between taking a look at the entire inventory, looking for items that are low in stock, adding stock, or adding a listing for a new item entirely.

#### The Supervisor is presented with two choices, a chance to see all categories of items (with their sales/profits), and to add a Department category.

Have fun!
