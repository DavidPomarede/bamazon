// Then create a Node application called bamazonCustomer.js. Running this application will first display 
// all of the items available for sale. Include the ids, names, and prices of products for sale.

// The app should then prompt users with two messages.

// The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
// The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.

// Once the customer has placed the order, your application should check if your store has enough of 
// the product to meet the customer's request.

// If not, the app should log a phrase like Insufficient quantity!, and then prevent the order from going through.

// However, if your store does have enough of the product, you should fulfill the customer's order.

// This means updating the SQL database to reflect the remaining quantity.
// Once the update goes through, show the customer the total cost of their purchase.
